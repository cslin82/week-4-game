# CrystalsCollector Game
Week 4 game for HW4

Using HTML, CSS, and jQuery JavaScript, build a game where the player uses four crystals with random point values to reach a target value. Player wins by hitting the target score, and loses when the score goes above the target. Game keeps track of target and random values for crystals internally without display. Game displays current round score and total scoreboard. This leaves it up to the player to remember the crystal values.

* The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
* Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
