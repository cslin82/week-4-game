# CrystalCollector pseudocode and planning

## HTML elements

* scoreboard for wins/losses
* current score
* target score
* crystal1, crystal2, crystal3, crystal4 (or array of crystals 0-3)

jQuery objects needed for all **when are the jQuery objects created? does it all go inside the document ready function block?**

Could we just make the buttons like the refrigerator buttons from the class exercise?


## Variables needed

* current score
* crystal values (array?)
* 

## Functions/routines needed

* randomInt(min, max) - returns an int between min and max inclusive
* event listners for click on each crystal
* win/loss checker
* reset game
    * re-randomzie crystal and target values
